During the curing process, a fiber-reinforced composite transforms into a stable material. The current project introduces two advanced models for analyzing residual stresses in composites: the viscoelastic model and the path-dependent model. These models offer significantly greater accuracy compared to linear elastic ones but involve added complexity. The project implements these models in Abaqus CAE, using Fortran subroutines (USDFLD, UMAT, HETVAL, UEXPAN, DISP)

For verification, we have compared the residual stress with the results provided in the reference papers, as shown in the next figure.
